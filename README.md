# odin-library

## Project Description
This project was made to get practice with JavaScript objects and also get a chance to use more Flexbox + Grid in combination. This project is an online library,  known as "Your Local Online Library" but I like to call it "Your LOL". Here you can add books to your collection via a form, I tried to style the form to look like an old-school notepad. I enjoyed the project as it was a good way to get a lot JS practice with things I have little experience (classes) and things I feel comfortable with (basic DOM manipulation). I also enjoyed the creation/modification of HTML and CSS via JavaScript! It was nice to have "total" control of the webpage in one language.

## Challenges Faced
Desinging
  * Before starting this project (in terms of coding) I wanted to create a nice elaborate library layout. When I went to draw some nice layout ideas I had none. So I went with a simple approach. It looks nice but it's nothing fancy. I like to code and challenge myself to recreate designs, designing from stratch is not my best skill.
